<title>Low or No Secondary Voltage Reading (all other readings
appear normal)</title>
</head>

<div>
<h3>No Secondary Voltage Reading (all other readings appear normal) </h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/LowOrNoSecondaryVoltageReading.png" /></p>
<p>This condition suggests that there is a suspected failure in the
secondary voltage metering system. This condition is unlikely to be
related to the precipitator. It is more likely to be related to the
performance of the electrical equipment. It is quite possible at this
stage to assume that this is probably affecting the performance of the
Precipitator. Potential side effects are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Failure of the control to correctly detect sparks and arcs
	within the ESP.</li>
	<li>Failure of the control to correctly limit its output to a
	preset secondary voltage level.</li>
	<li>Random under voltage trips.</li>
</ul>
Note: A failure of the high voltage divider (if mounted in the TR oil)
could allow arcing across a failed resistor that might degrade the
insulation properties of the TR Oil.
<p></p>
<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p>The secondary voltage measured on the system may be displayed in
two locations. You may have one or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Analog Meters on the cabinet door</li>
	<li>Digital readings on the Automatic Voltage control</li>
</ul>
The secondary voltage signal is typically a reference voltage signal
derived across a voltage divider feedback resistor. This feedback
resistor is typically located in the low voltage junction box or TR
ground switch enclosure.
<ul>
	<li>Locate the shunt resistor and measure its resistance.</li>
	<li>Check the operations manual for your system and determine
	whether or not the resistor is set correctly. If not, set is correctly.</li>
	<li>This resistor is typically calibrated to provide a voltage
	signal to the AVC.</li>
	<li>It is also possible that the surge arrestor in the TR low
	voltage junction box may have shorted out and will be causing the shunt
	resistor to be shorted to ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>This resistor is typically calibrated to provide a voltage signal
to the AVC. The analog meter may use the same signal or may be a direct
current reading device where the current that passes through the meter
is proportional to the voltage on the ESP. If the analog meter does not
read the calculated value correctly then the meter may be at fault. If
the AVC does not read correctly, it is quite possible that the AVC is
out of calibration or is malfunctioning. If the voltage is not present
across the shunt resistor, replace the shunt resistor, re-calibrate, and
recheck the signal. If the signal still is not present there is probably
a fault within the transformer tank. There are numerous steps involved
in the fault finding of the High Voltage system on an ESP TR set. Some
of them are very specific to the manufacturer of your TR and AVCâ€™s.
These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Meggering the high voltage resistor that may be in the TR oil
	or the HV duct.</li>
	<li>Measuring the current through the High Voltage resistor to
	ground.</li>
	<li>Measuring the voltage across the voltage divider resistor to
	ground.</li>
</ul>
The last two of these tests are dangerous and should not be attempted
other than by a fully trained TR technician.
