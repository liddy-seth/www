<title>Circuit Breaker Trips</title>

<h3>Circuit Breaker Trips</h3>
<p>This condition may be related to the precipitator or to the
electrical control system. It will definitely affect the performance of
the Precipitator since any field not operating correctly will have
impact on the outlet emissions. Indications are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The TR control will not keep the ESP field energized.</li>
	<li>Consistently shows low voltage with surges of high current.</li>
	<li>TR cabinet / MCC circuit breaker trips frequently.</li>
</ul>
Possible causes of the above events are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>AVC or firing circuit malfunction.</li>
	<li>Faulty circuit breaker.</li>
	<li>SCR shorted or misfiring.</li>
	<li>Incorrect primary current signal.</li>
	<li>Incorrect "Phasing‚Äù of the SCRs.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p>If the microprocessor control and SCR pack are operating properly
the AVC will de-energize the control and display an over current trip
message without tripping the breaker. Failure of the AVC to do this
requires the following steps to be taken:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Replace the AVC and or Firing circuit - Retest</li>
	<li>To eliminate a short to ground in the control cabinet as the
	problem, disconnect the field wiring going to the primary of the
	transformer rectifier. Connect four 110 volt incandescent lamps in
	series across the output of the cabinet. Since the cabinet no longer
	has a substantial load, re-energizing the cabinet should produce line
	voltage and very very low current. The light bulbs will go to full
	brightness and measuring the voltage across them will show the full
	mains voltage. If the breaker trips there is a ground fault in the
	cabinet.</li>
	<li>Performing the light bulb test and ensuring the voltage across
	the ligh bulbs rises smoothly to the mains voltage will verify the
	connections to the SCR gate / cathodes is correct. While on the light
	bulb load, the breaker will not trip, but intermittent flashing of the
	light bulbs or spurious output to them would indicate incorrect
	connections to the SCR gate / cathodes. If a TR load were connected at
	this time, there is a high probability of tripping the circuit breaker,
	blowing a line fuse and even damaging the SCR pack.</li>
	<li>If after performing all the above checks it is determined that
	all components are in proper working order yet the breaker continues to
	trip, replace the breaker. As a double check, place a recording amp
	meter on the line feed between the breaker and the contactor. If the
	current does not exceed the control rating, yet the breaker keeps
	tripping, the breaker is definitely defective.</li>
</ul>
