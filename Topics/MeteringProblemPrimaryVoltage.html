<h3>No or Low Primary Voltage Reading(all other readings appear
normal)</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/NoOrLowPrimaryVoltageReading.png" /></p>
<p>This condition suggests that there is a suspected failure in the
primary voltage metering system. This condition is very unlikely to be
related to the precipitator. It is more likely to be related to the
performance of the electrical equipment. It is reasonable at this stage
to assume that this indication is not affecting the performance of the
Precipitator. Other potential side effects are: Failure of the control
to correctly determine a true under voltage condition. Failure of the
control to correctly limit its output to a preset primary voltage level.
</p>
<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p>The primary voltage measured on the system may be displayed in
two locations. You may have one or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Analog Meters on the cabinet door</li>
	<li>Digital readings on the Automatic Voltage Control (AVC)</li>
</ul>
In the case of Analog Meters, measuring the voltage on the back of the
meter will provide a clue as to whether the meter is defective or not.
In the case of the Automatic Voltage Control, the primary voltage signal
measurement is typically taken from the secondary of a potential
transformer (PT) whose primary is across the primary of the transformer
rectifier (TR). Determine the ratio of your PT and using the measured
voltage on the primary, determine the voltage that should be on the
secondary. If the calculated voltage is not present on the secondary of
the PT, then further fault finding is required. Some of the
possibilities include:
<ul>
	<li>Defective wiring between TR Primary and the PT Primary.</li>
	<li>Defective PT.</li>
	<li>Blown fuse(s) in either the Primary or the secondary wiring of
	the PT (The Primary fuses may be in the Low Voltage Junction Box of the
	TR set).</li>
	<li>Defective wiring between PT and Control Board.</li>
	<li>Failure of the Control Board.</li>
</ul>
