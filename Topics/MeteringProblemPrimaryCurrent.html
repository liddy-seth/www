<h3>No or Low Primary Current Reading (all other readings appear normal)</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/NoOrLowPrimaryCurrentReading.png" /></p>
<p>
	This condition suggests that there is a suspected failure in the primary current metering system. This condition is very unlikely to be related to the precipitator. It is more likely to be related to the performance of the electrical equipment.

It is reasonable at this stage to assume that this indication is not severely affecting the performance of the Precipitator.

It should none the less be of concern since a low current reading could allow the TR control to over-run the current limit of the system and allow more current to flow in the primary circuit than it is designed to handle. This could be catastrophic and could cause SCR, CLR and even TR failure. 

Other potential side effects are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Failure of the control to correctly limit its output to a preset primary current level.</li>
<li>Failure of the control to correctly discriminate between arcs and sparks within the ESP.</li>
<li>Failure of the control to correctly determine a true under voltage condition.</li>
<li>Failure of the Control to correctly determine an over-current condition.</li>
<li>Failure to correctly determine an SCR imbalance condition.</li>
<li>Random Circuit Breaker Trips</li>
</ul>

<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p>
	The primary current measured on the System may be displayed in two locations. You may have one or both of the following:
</p>
	<ul>
<li>Analog Meters on the cabinet door</li>
<li>Digital readings on the Automatic Voltage control</li>
</ul>
In the Case of Analog Meters:
<ul>
<li>Check the TR Primary current with a true RMS AC clamp-on ammeter. </li>
<li>Compare the readings on the two meters, this will provide a clue as to whether the analog meter is accurate or not.</li>
</ul>
In the case of the (AVC) Automatic Voltage Control: 
The most common method of providing the current reading to the controller is by measuring the voltage a cross a resistor that is in series with a CT (Current Transformer).
The voltage that is measured across this resistor is typically fed to the AVC. Measure the voltage across this resistor and using the formula â€œCurrent flowing in the TR Primary = CT Ratio x (Voltage measured across the resistor / Resistance of the Resistor)". 
If the calculated current is not displayed correctly on the AVC then further fault finding is required. Some of the possibilities include:
<ul>
<li>Defective or incorrectly set Resistor.</li>
<li>Defective CT.</li>
<li>Defective wiring between CT / resistor and Control Board.</li>
<li>Failure of the Control Board.</li>
</ul>
