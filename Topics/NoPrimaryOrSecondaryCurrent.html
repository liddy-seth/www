<h3>No Primary or Secondary Current (high or rated primary voltage and secondary voltage)</h3>
<p><img alt=""

<p>This condition will definitely affect the performance of the
Precipitator since any field not operating correctly will have impact on
the outlet emissions. Indications are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The TR control displays a moderate voltage (approx. 50% of the
	line voltage), rated kV, with no primary or secondary current .</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible causes of the above events are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>TR ground switch position.</li>
	<li>High voltage disconnected from the precipitator.</li>
	<li>TR failure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p>This condition occurs when there is no load on the TR set HV
Bushing. The first step in determining the cause is to check that the TR
disconnect switches are properly made. If they are, place a temporary
ground on the high voltage bushing of the TR. If the TR is a double half
wave configuration (two output bushings) make sure the two bushings are
tied together for full wave operation. With a ground on the secondary of
the TR the control should reach the primary or secondary current limit
programmed into the control, and low primary voltage with no secondary
voltage. If rated current is present the problem lies in an open circuit
between the TR output bushings and the support bushing tie-in point for
the high voltage frame. If after grounding the TR high voltage
bushing(s) the current is still zero, the problem lies within the TR
set, megger the primary and secondary of the TR per the manufacturerâ€™s
instructions. If an open circuit exits on the primary, the TR will have
to be removed for repair. If the open is on the secondary, remove and
check the full wave diode bridge for an open leg(s). If the diode bridge
is open, replace the diode stack and retest. If the current is still
zero, check the RF coils located between the diode bridge and the output
bushing(s) for an open condition. If the no current condition still
exists the secondary winding of the transformer core is open and the
core will need to be replaced.</p>
