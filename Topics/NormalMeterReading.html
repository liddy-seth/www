<h3>Normal Meter Readings</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/NormalMeter.png" /></p>
<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p>This portion of the App does not know what your TR sets and
controls are rated at and so cannot absolutely determine what a normal
set of readings might be. The above meters are typical (or normal) for a
TR set rated as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Primary Voltage max – 460 Volts AC</li>
	<li>Primary Current Max – 123 Amps AC</li>
	<li>Secondary Voltage Max – 55 Kv DC</li>
	<li>Secondary Current Max – 750 Ma DC</li>
</ul>
<p>As can be seen from the meter positions above, none of the meters
are indicating the maximum rating of the TR set. They are not
specifically low in any instance. The conclusions would in this instance
be: The control is sparking and provided the AVC response is
satisfactory – Operation is Normal. The control is limited by the AVC to
one or more of the setpoints as shown in the meters and the control is
not sparking – Operation is Normal. The Opacity is within defined
limited and an energy management routine is in operation – Operation is
Normal. We value comments to this App and look forward to hearing any
you may have.</p>
