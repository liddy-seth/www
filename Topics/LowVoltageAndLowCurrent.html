<h3>Low Voltage and Low Current</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="../img/LowVoltageAndLowCurrent.png" /></p>
<p>This condition will definitely affect the performance of the
Precipitator since any field not operating correctly will have impact on
the outlet emissions. When both the voltage and current are low it
usually means that either excessive sparking is occurring in the
precipitator or electrical noise is entering the control cabinet.
Possible causes of the above events are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Heavy buildups on either or both the discharge electrodes or
	collecting electrodes</li>
	<li>One or more full hoppers</li>
	<li>Dirty insulators</li>
	<li>Poorly selected AVC responses</li>
	<li>Process Conditions</li>
	<li>Possible Electrical Noise</li>
</ul>

<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Check operation of your rapper control, increase lift,
	increase energization speed. Adjust frequency of operation in the
	instance where tumbling hammers are utilized.</li>
	<li>Energize hopper vibrators. Sledge hammer the hopper walls.</li>
	<li>Check insulator purge air system.</li>
	<li>Check blast heaters or individual hopper heaters, make sure
	all are operating and up to temperature.</li>
	<li>Investigate the performance of the AVC by checking parameters
	such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Ramp / Recovery rate</li>
		<li>Step / Phase back</li>
		<li>Arc response</li>
		<li>Spark response</li>
		<li>Process condition upsets that may result from:
		<ul>
			<li>Large swings in process operation</li>
			<li>Boiler tube leak</li>
			<li>Operation below process gas dew point</li>
			<li>Temporary firing of low sulfur fuel</li>
			<li>Increase in particulate loading</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Electrical noise can enter the control through the electrical
line feed or through the feedback signals from the secondary of the TR.
Typically; the only noise that affects the control through the line feed
is fast rise time transients generated by variable frequency drives or
SCR type motor speed controls. An Oscilloscope will be necessary to
detect these transients. If they are present, adding inductive filters
to the feed of the offending motor control will usually solve the
problem. The common entry of noise is through the TR secondary feedback
signals. (In particular, the secondary current signal.) Electrical noise
on this line can be interpreted by the control as sparking, and cause
the control to back down on power in an effort to maintain a reasonable
spark rate. Check for noise on the secondary current signal, with an
oscilloscope.</p>
