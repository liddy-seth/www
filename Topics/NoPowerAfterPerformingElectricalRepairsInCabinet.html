<h3>No Power After Performing Electrical Repairs in Cabinet</h3>
<p><img alt=""

<p>This often happens after repairs to the AVC, firing circuit, SCR
pack or control transformer have been carried out. The control is turned
on and no output appears on the TR set. Possible causes of the above
events are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Blown Main line fuses.</li>
	<li>Reconnection of replaced components is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>COURSE OF ACTION:</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Check to see if the main line fuses are blown.</li>
	<li>The SCRs are typically synchronized to line phase. Therefore,
	if the SCR1 and SCR2 gate and cathode leads get switched or the wiring
	to the new control transformer get switched, or the new transformer is
	wound differently, the SCRs will be out of phase and no power will
	flow. To fix this problem, either swap the SCR1 and SCR2 gate and
	cathode leads on Control Board or Firing Circuit, or swap the wiring on
	the secondary of the control transformer.</li>
	<li>An out of phase condition can also be detected by observing
	the conduction angle. If the conduction angle is full-on and the
	control has no power output, both SCRs are out of phase or open
	circuited.</li>
</ul>
